Give me further particulars.What did Colonel Forster say?Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?They must have seen them together for ever.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,especially on Lydia\u0026#39;s side,but nothing to give him any alarm.I am so grieved for him!His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.He was coming to us,in order to assure us of his concern,before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland:when that apprehension first got abroad,it hastened his journey.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off?Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans,and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt,I suppose,of their being really married?”","cnt":0,"sort":14011572,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011571.html","next":"14011573.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
