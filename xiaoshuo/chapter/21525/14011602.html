Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I must ask whether you were surprised?”said Elizabeth.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.”And though he exclaimed at the term,she found that it had been pretty much the case.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “On the evening before my going to London,”said he,“I made a confession to him,which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great.He had never had the slightest suspicion.I told him, moreover,that I believed myself mistaken in supposing,as I had done,that your sister was indifferent to him;and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated,I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Did you speak from your own observation,”said she,“when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “From the former.I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here;and I was convinced of her affection.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “And your assurance of it,I suppose,carried immediate conviction to him.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing,which for a time,and not unjustly, offended him.I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter,that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded,lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister\u0026#39;s sentiments.He has heartily forgiven me now.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr.Bingley had been a most delightful friend;so easily guided that his worth was invaluable;but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,which of course was to be inferior only to his own,he continued the conversation till they reached the house.In the hall they parted.","cnt":0,"sort":14011602,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011601.html","next":"14011603.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
