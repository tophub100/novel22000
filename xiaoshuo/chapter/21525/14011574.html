She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham\u0026#39;s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before,had been almost an angel of light.He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\u0026#39;s family.Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.Elizabeth,though she did not credit above half of what was said,believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister\u0026#39;s ruin more certain;and even Jane,who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when,if they had gone to Scotland,which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him;it told them that,on his arrival,he had immediately found out his brother,and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;that Mr.Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham,before his arrival,but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,before they procured lodgings.Mr.Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure,but as his brother was eager in it,he meant to assist him in pursuing it.He added that Mr.Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon.There was also a post to this effect:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out,if possible,from some of the young man\u0026#39;s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that,it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say,do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head.But, on second thoughts,perhaps,Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living,better than any other person.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother,both of whom had been dead many years.It was possible,however,that some of his companions in the—shire might be able to give more information;and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it,the application was a something to look forward to.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety;but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning\u0026#39;s impatience. Through letters,whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated,and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But before they heard again from Mr.Gardiner,a letter arrived for their father,from a different quarter,from Mr.Collins;which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,she accordingly read;and Elizabeth,who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.It was as follows:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “MY DEAR SIR,","cnt":0,"sort":14011574,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011573.html","next":"14011575.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
