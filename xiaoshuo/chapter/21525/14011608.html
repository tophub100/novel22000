He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her;and in spite of every thing,was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage,explained to her that,by his wife at least,if not by himself,such a hope was cherished.The letter was to this effect:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “My Dear Lizzy,\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham,you must be very happy.It is a great comfort to have you so rich,and when you have nothing else to do,I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much,and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.Any place would do,of about three or four hundred a year;but however,do not speak to Mr.Darcy about it,if you had rather not.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Yours,etc.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.Such relief,however,as it was in her power to afford,by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences,she frequently sent them.It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs,under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants,and heedless of the future,must be very insufficient to their support;and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.Their manner of living,even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home,was unsettled in the extreme.They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation,and always spending more than they ought.His affection for her soon sunk into indifference;hers lasted a little longer;and in spite of her youth and her manners,she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth\u0026#39;s sake,he assisted him further in his profession.Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long,that even Bingley\u0026#39;s good humour was overcome,and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\u0026#39;s marriage;but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley,she dropt all her resentment;was fonder than ever of Georgiana,almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore,and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Pemberley was now Georgiana\u0026#39;s home;and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.They were able to love each other even as well as they intended.Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively,sportive manner of talking to her brother.He,who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection,she now saw the object of open pleasantry.Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.By Elizabeth\u0026#39;s instructions,she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length,by Elizabeth\u0026#39;s persuasion,he was prevailed on to overlook the offence,and seek a reconciliation;and,after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way,either to her affection for him,or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley,in spite of that pollution which its woods had received,not merely from the presence of such a mistress,but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.","cnt":0,"sort":14011608,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011607.html","next":"","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
