She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge,therefore(for through their communication with the Collinses,the report,she concluded,had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate,which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     In revolving Lady Catherine\u0026#39;s expressions,however,she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage,it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt,or his dependence on her judgment,but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do;and it was certain that,in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one,whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     If he had been wavering before as to what he should do,which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.In that case he would return no more.Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town;and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days,”she added,“I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.If he is satisfied with only regretting me,when he might have obtained my affections and hand,I shall soon cease to regret him at all.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The surprise of the rest of the family,on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.Bennet\u0026#39;s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The next morning,as she was going downstairs,she was met by her father,who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Lizzy,”said he,“I was going to look for you; come into my room.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.He then said,\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.As it principally concerns yourself,you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The colour now rushed into Elizabeth\u0026#39;s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,instead of the aunt;and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself;when her father continued:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You look conscious.Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these;but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.This letter is from Mr. Collins.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “From Mr.Collins!and what can he have to say?”","cnt":0,"sort":14011598,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011597.html","next":"14011599.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
