But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family,when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street.Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day,opened to them a new idea on the business.Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth\u0026#39;s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure;but amongst other causes of disquiet,she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour;and,more than commonly anxious to please,she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She retreated from the window,fearful of being seen;and as she walked up and down the room,endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Miss Darcy was tall,and on a larger scale than Elizabeth;and, though little more than sixteen,her figure was formed,and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     They had not been long together before Mr.Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her;and she had barely time to express her satisfaction,and prepare for such a visitor,when Bingley\u0026#39;s quick step was heard on the stairs,and in a moment he entered the room.All Elizabeth\u0026#39;s anger against him had been long done away;but had she still felt any,it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way,after her family,and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.They had long wished to see him.The whole party before them,indeed,excited a lively attention.The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry;and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.Of the lady\u0026#39;s sensations they remained a little in doubt;but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own,and to make herself agreeable to all;and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success,for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready,Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined,to be pleased.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     In seeing Bingley,her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;and, oh!how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions,and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.But,though this might be imaginary,she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy,who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted,which,in her anxious interpretation,denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness,and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her,had he dared. He observed to her,at a moment when the others were talking together,and in a tone which had something of real regret,that it“was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;”and,before she could reply,he added,“It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November,when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her,when unattended to by any of the rest,whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.There was not much in the question,nor in the preceding remark;but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.","cnt":0,"sort":14011561,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011560.html","next":"14011562.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
