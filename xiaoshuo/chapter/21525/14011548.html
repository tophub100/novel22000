Jane will be quite an old maid soon,I declare.She is almost three-and-twenty!Lord,how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands,you can\u0026#39;t think.She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it.Lord!how I should like to be married before any of you;and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.Dear me!we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\u0026#39;s.Kitty and me were to spend the day there,and Mrs.Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!)and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\u0026#39;s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!Not a soul knew of it,but Colonel and Mrs. Forster,and Kitty and me,except my aunt,for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!When Denny,and Wickham,and Pratt,and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord!how I laughed!and so did Mrs.Forster.I thought I should have died.And that made the men suspect something,and then they soon found out what was the matter.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes,did Lydia,assisted by Kitty\u0026#39;s hints and additions,endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\u0026#39;s name.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Their reception at home was most kind.Mrs.Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty;and more than once during dinner did Mr.Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I am glad you are come back,Lizzy.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them:Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter;Mrs.Bennet was doubly engaged,on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane,who sat some way below her,and,on the other,retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\u0026#39;s,was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh!Mary,”said she,“I wish you had gone with us,for we had such fun!As we went along,Kitty and I drew up the blinds,and pretended there was nobody in the coach;and I should have gone so all the way,if Kitty had not been sick;and when we got to the George,I do think we behaved very handsomely,for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world,and if you would have gone,we would have treated you too.And then when we came away it was such fun!I thought we never should have got into the coach.I was ready to die of laughter.And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     To this Mary very gravely replied,“Far be it from me,my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures!They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.But I confess they would have no charms for me—I should infinitely prefer a book.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.There was another reason too for her opposition.She dreaded seeing Mr.Wickham again,and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.The comfort to her of the regiment\u0026#39;s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone,she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme,of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,was under frequent discussion between her parents.Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal,that her mother,though often disheartened,had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.","cnt":0,"sort":14011548,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011547.html","next":"14011549.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
