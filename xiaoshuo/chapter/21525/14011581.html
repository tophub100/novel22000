He has the promise of an ensigncy in General—\u0026#39;s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.He promises fairly;and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.Wickham in and near Brighton,with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information?He has given in all his debts;I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn;and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South.She is well,and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.—Yours,etc.,\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “E.GARDINER.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\u0026#39;s removal from the—shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.But Mrs.Bennet was not so well pleased with it.Lydia\u0026#39;s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody,and had so many favourites.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,”said she,“it will be quite shocking to send her away!And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.The officers may not be so pleasant in General—\u0026#39;s regiment.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     His daughter\u0026#39;s request,for such it might be considered,of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing,for the sake of their sister\u0026#39;s feelings and consequence,that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married,that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr.Bennet wrote again to his brother,therefore,he sent his permission for them to come;and it was settled,that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised,however,that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.","cnt":0,"sort":14011581,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011580.html","next":"14011582.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
