My mother means well;but she does not know,no one can know,how much I suffer from what she says.Happy shall I be,when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I wish I could say anything to comfort you,”replied Elizabeth;“but it is wholly out of my power.You must feel it;and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire,she saw him, from her dressing-room window,enter the paddock and ride towards the house.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table;but Elizabeth,to satisfy her mother,went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr.Darcy with him,and sat down again by her sister.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “There is a gentleman with him,mamma,”said Kitty;“who can it be?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Some acquaintance or other,my dear,I suppose;I am sure I do not know.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “La!”replied Kitty,“it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.Mr.what\u0026#39;s-his-name.That tall,proud man.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow.Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u0026#39;s will always be welcome here, to be sure;but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u0026#39;s friend, without being heard by either of them.But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u0026#39;s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.To Jane,he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,and whose merit she had undervalued;but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest,if not quite so tender,at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield,to Longbourn,and voluntarily seeking her again,was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The colour which had been driven from her face,returned for half a minute with an additional glow,and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes,as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.But she would not be secure.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Let me first see how he behaves,”said she;“it will then be early enough for expectation.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She sat intently at work,striving to be composed,and without daring to lift up her eyes,till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.Jane looked a little paler than usual,but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.On the gentlemen\u0026#39;s appearing,her colour increased;yet she received them with tolerable ease,and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow,and sat down again to her work,with an eagerness which it did not often command.She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.He looked serious,as usual;and,she thought,more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\u0026#39;s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable,conjecture.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Bingley,she had likewise seen for an instant,and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.","cnt":0,"sort":14011588,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011587.html","next":"14011589.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
