There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\u0026#39;s frailty would have mortified her so much—not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.Had Lydia\u0026#39;s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms,it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family,where to every other objection,would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.The wish of procuring her regard,which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved;she repented,though she hardly knew of what.She became jealous of his esteem,when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.She wanted to hear of him,when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.She was convinced that she could have been happy with him,when it was no longer likely they should meet.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     What a triumph for him,as she often thought,could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened,his manners improved;and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency,and precluding the possibility of the other,was soon to be formed in their family.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,she could not imagine.But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\u0026#39;s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family;and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr.Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.","cnt":0,"sort":14011580,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011579.html","next":"14011581.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
