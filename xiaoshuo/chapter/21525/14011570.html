It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless,and who was actually staying in his colonel\u0026#39;s family,that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment,after such an affront to Colonel Forster?His temptation is not adequate to the risk!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Do you really think so?”cried Elizabeth,brightening up for a moment.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Upon my word,”said Mrs. Gardiner,“I begin to be of your uncle\u0026#39;s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour,and interest,for him to be guilty of it.I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.Can you yourself,Lizzy,so wholly give him up,as to believe him capable of it?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Not,perhaps,of neglecting his own interest;but of every other neglect I can believe him capable.If,indeed,it should be so!But I dare not hope it.Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “In the first place,”replied Mr.Gardiner,“there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh!but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption!And,besides,no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side;and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But why all this secrecy?Why any fear of detection?Why must their marriage be private?Oh,no,no—this is not likely.His most particular friend,you see by Jane\u0026#39;s account,was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.He cannot afford it.And what claims has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth,health,and good humour that could make him,for her sake,forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her,I am not able to judge;for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.But as to your other objection,I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\u0026#39;s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family,that he would do as little,and think as little about it,as any father could do,in such a matter.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It does seem,and it is most shocking indeed,”replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,“that a sister\u0026#39;s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.Perhaps I am not doing her justice.But she is very young;she has never been taught to think on serious subjects;and for the last half-year,nay,for a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner,and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the—shire were first quartered in Meryton,nothing but love,flirtation,and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?susceptibility to her feelings;which are naturally lively enough.And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But you see that Jane,”said her aunt,“does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Of whom does Jane ever think ill?And who is there,whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word;that he has neither integrity nor honour;that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “And do you really know all this?”cried Mrs.Gardiner,whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I do indeed,”replied Elizabeth, colouring.“I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself,when last at Longbourn,heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate;but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,reserved, disagreeable girl.Yet he knew to the contrary himself.He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But does Lydia know nothing of this?can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?”","cnt":0,"sort":14011570,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011569.html","next":"14011571.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
