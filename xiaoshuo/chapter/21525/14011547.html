I am glad he is gone.I never saw such a long chin in my life.Well, but now for my news;it is about dear Wickham;too good for the waiter,is it not?There is no danger of Wickham\u0026#39;s marrying Mary King.There\u0026#39;s for you!She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool:gone to stay.Wickham is safe.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “And Mary King is safe!”added Elizabeth;“safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “She is a great fool for going away,if she liked him.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,”said Jane.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her—who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth was shocked to think that,however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     As soon as all had ate,and the elder ones paid,the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes,work-bags,and parcels,and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\u0026#39;s and Lydia\u0026#39;s purchases,were seated in it.","cnt":0,"sort":14011547,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011546.html","next":"14011548.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
