Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell,you will be attended to.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,and as she did not answer them all herself,attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied,she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours;whenever she was alone,she gave way to it as the greatest relief;and not a day went by without a solitary walk,in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr. Darcy\u0026#39;s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.When she remembered the style of his address,she was still full of indignation;but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself;and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude,his general character respect;but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret;and in the unhappy defects of her family,a subject of yet heavier chagrin.They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them,would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself,was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;but while they were supported by their mother\u0026#39;s indulgence,what chance could there be of improvement?Catherine,weak-spirited,irritable,and completely under Lydia\u0026#39;s guidance,had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.They were ignorant, idle, and vain.While there was an officer in Meryton,they would flirt with him;and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Anxiety on Jane\u0026#39;s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy\u0026#39;s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.How grievous then was the thought that,of a situation so desirable in every respect,so replete with advantage,so promising for happiness,Jane had been deprived,by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham\u0026#39;s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first.The very last evening was spent there;and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way,that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return,to undo all the work of the morning,and pack her trunk afresh.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     When they parted,Lady Catherine,with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.","cnt":0,"sort":14011545,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011544.html","next":"14011546.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
