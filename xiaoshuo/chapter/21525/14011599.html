He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience,by reading what he says on that point.What relates to yourself, is as follows: \u0026#39;Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;of which we have been advertised by the same authority.Your daughter Elizabeth,it is presumed,will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it,and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.\u0026#39;\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?”\u0026#39;This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, —splendid property,noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman\u0026#39;s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.\u0026#39;\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “\u0026#39;My motive for cautioning you is as follows.We have reason to imagine that his aunt,Lady Catherine de Bourgh,does not look on the match with a friendly eye.\u0026#39;\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you.Could he,or the Lucases,have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!It is admirable!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth tried to join in her father\u0026#39;s pleasantry,but could only force one most reluctant smile.Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Are you not diverted?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh!yes.Pray read on.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “\u0026#39;After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night,she immediately,with her usual condescension,expressed what she felt on the occasion;when it became apparent,that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin,she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin,that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about,and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\u0026#39;Mr.Collins moreover adds,\u0026#39;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\u0026#39;s sad business has been so well hushed up,and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known.I must not, however,neglect the duties of my station,or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\u0026#39;That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\u0026#39;s situation,and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,Lizzy,you look as if you did not enjoy it.You are not going to be missish,I hope,and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live,but to make sport for our neighbours,and laugh at them in our turn?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh!”cried Elizabeth,“I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing;but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins\u0026#39;s correspondence for any consideration.Nay,when I read a letter of his,I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray,Lizzy,what said Lady Catherine about this report?Did she call to refuse her consent?”To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.It was necessary to laugh,when she would rather have cried.Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy\u0026#39;s indifference,and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration,or fear that perhaps,instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.","cnt":0,"sort":14011599,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011598.html","next":"14011600.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
