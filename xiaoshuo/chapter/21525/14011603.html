She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The evening passed quietly,unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed,the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;and Elizabeth,agitated and confused,rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so;for,besides the immediate embarrassment,there were other evils before her.She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known;she was aware that no one liked him but Jane;and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     At night she opened her heart to Jane.Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet\u0026#39;s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You are joking,Lizzy.This cannot be!—engaged to Mr.Darcy! No,no,you shall not deceive me.I know it to be impossible.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “This is a wretched beginning indeed!My sole dependence was on you;and I am sure nobody else will believe me,if you do not. Yet,indeed,I am in earnest.I speak nothing but the truth.He still loves me,and we are engaged.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Jane looked at her doubtingly.“Oh,Lizzy!it cannot be.I know how much you dislike him.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.But in such cases as these,a good memory is unpardonable.This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Good Heaven!can it be really so!Yet now I must believe you,”cried Jane.“My dear,dear Lizzy,I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain?forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “There can be no doubt of that.It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.But are you pleased,Jane?Shall you like to have such a brother?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Very,very much.Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.But we considered it,we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection.Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh, yes!You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “What do you mean?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Why,I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.I am afraid you will be angry.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “My dearest sister,now be serious.I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know,without delay.Will you tell me how long you have loved him?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It has been coming on so gradually,that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Another entreaty that she would be serious,however,produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.When convinced on that article,Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Now I am quite happy,”said she,“for you will be as happy as myself.I always had a value for him.Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\u0026#39;s friend and your husband,there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.But Lizzy,you have been very sly,very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley;and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\u0026#39;s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Good gracious!”cried Mrs.Bennet,as she stood at a window the next morning,“if that disagreeable Mr.Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley!What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again,that he may not be in Bingley\u0026#39;s way.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     As soon as they entered,Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth,as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud,“Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I advise Mr.Darcy,and Lizzy,and Kitty,”said Mrs.Bennet,“to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.It is a nice long walk,and Mr.Darcy has never seen the view.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It may do very well for the others,”replied Mr.Bingley;“but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.Won\u0026#39;t it,Kitty?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount,and Elizabeth silently consented.As she went upstairs to get ready,Mrs.Bennet followed her,saying:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I am quite sorry,Lizzy,that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself, but I hope you will not mind it.It is all for Jane\u0026#39;s sake,you know;and there is no occasion for talking to him,except just now and then.So,do not put yourself to inconvenience.”","cnt":0,"sort":14011603,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011602.html","next":"14011604.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
