Oh!Lizzy,to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!how shall I bear so much happiness!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party,and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled,that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “And this,”said she,“is the end of all his friend\u0026#39;s anxious circumspection!of all his sister\u0026#39;s falsehood and contrivance!the happiest,wisest,most reasonable end!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley,whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Where is your sister?”said he hastily,as he opened the door.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He then shut the door,and,coming up to her,claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality;and then,till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\u0026#39;s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover,Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet\u0026#39;s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled,and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs.Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour;and when Mr.Bennet joined them at supper,his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Not a word,however,passed his lips in allusion to it,till their visitor took his leave for the night;but as soon as he was gone,he turned to his daughter,and said:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Jane,I congratulate you.You will be a very happy woman.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Jane went to him instantly,kissed him,and thanked him for his goodness.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You are a good girl;”he replied,“and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.Your tempers are by no means unlike.You are each of you so complying,that nothing will ever be resolved on;so easy,that every servant will cheat you;and so generous,that you will always exceed your income.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.”","cnt":0,"sort":14011593,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011592.html","next":"14011594.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
