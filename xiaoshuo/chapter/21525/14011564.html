Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house,and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.In this house they were received by Miss Darcy,who was sitting there with Mrs.Hurst and Miss Bingley,and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana\u0026#39;s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved.Mrs.Gardiner and her niece,however, did her justice,and pitied her.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,succeeded for a few moments.It was first broken by Mrs.Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;and between her and Mrs.Gardiner,with occasional help from Elizabeth,the conversation was carried on.Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,and that she could not speak a word,especially to Miss Darcy,without calling her attention.This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter,had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.She wished,she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most,she could scarcely determine.After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley\u0026#39;s voice,Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity,and the others said no more.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season;but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given,to remind her of her post.There was now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all talk,they could all eat;and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines,and peaches soon collected them round the table.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.Darcy,by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate,she began to regret that he came.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\u0026#39;s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.Miss Darcy,on her brother\u0026#39;s entrance,exerted herself much more to talk,and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted,and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise;and,in the imprudence of anger,took the first opportunity of saying,with sneering civility:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the—shire Militia removed from Meryton?They must be a great loss to your family.”","cnt":0,"sort":14011564,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011563.html","next":"14011565.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
