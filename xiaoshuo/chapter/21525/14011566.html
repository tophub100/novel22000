Imagine our surprise.To Kitty, however,it does not seem so wholly unexpected.I am very,very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him,but this step (and let us rejoice over it)marks nothing bad at heart.His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.Our poor mother is sadly grieved.My father bears it better.How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him;we must forget it ourselves.They were off Saturday night about twelve,as is conjectured,but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,informing her of their intention. I must conclude,for I cannot be long from my poor mother.I am afraid you will not be able to make it out,but I hardly know what I have written.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt,Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other,and opening it with the utmost impatience,read as follows:it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.","cnt":0,"sort":14011566,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011565.html","next":"14011567.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
