Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight,and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge.The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\u0026#39;s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth,though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought,when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James\u0026#39;s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mrs.Phillips\u0026#39;s vulgarity was another,and perhaps,a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister,stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\u0026#39;s good humour encouraged,yet, whenever she did speak,she must be vulgar.Nor was her respect for him,though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either,and was ever anxious to keep him to herself,and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification;and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future;and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either,to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs.Darcy,may be guessed.I wish I could say,for the sake of her family,that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,amiable,well-informed woman for the rest of her life;though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form,that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.He delighted in going to Pemberley,especially when he was least expected.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr.Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper,or her affectionate heart.The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified;he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire,and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness,were within thirty miles of each other.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia;and,removed from the influence of Lydia\u0026#39;s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia\u0026#39;s society she was of course carefully kept,and though Mrs.Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her,with the promise of balls and young men,her father would never consent to her going.","cnt":0,"sort":14011607,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011606.html","next":"14011608.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
