Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.They lagged behind,while Elizabeth,Kitty,and Darcy were to entertain each other.Very little was said by either;Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk;Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution;and perhaps he might be doing the same.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed,and,while her courage was high,she immediately said:“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.Ever since I have known it,I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.Were it known to the rest of my family,I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,”replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion,“that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs.Gardiner was so little to be trusted.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You must not blame my aunt. Lydia\u0026#39;s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter;and,of course,I could not rest till I knew the particulars.Let me thank you again and again,in the name of all my family,for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,and bear so many mortifications,for the sake of discovering them.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “If you will thank me,”he replied,“let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on,I shall not attempt to deny.But your family owe me nothing.Much as I respect them,I believe I thought only of you.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.After a short pause,her companion added,“You are too generous to trifle with me.If your feelings are still what they were last April,tell me so at once.My affections and wishes are unchanged,but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change,since the period to which he alluded,as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.The happiness which this reply produced,was such as he had probably never felt before;and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye,she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;but,though she could not look,she could listen,and he told her of feelings,which,in proving of what importance she was to him,made his affection every moment more valuable.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     They walked on, without knowing in what direction.There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt,who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth;dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship\u0026#39;s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give.But,unluckily for her ladyship,its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It taught me to hope,”said he,“as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,had you been absolutely,irrevocably decided against me,you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,frankly and openly.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied,“Yes,you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face,I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “What did you say of me,that I did not deserve?For,though your accusations were ill-founded,formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable.I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,”said Elizabeth.“The conduct of neither,if strictly examined,will be irreproachable;but since then,we have both,I hope,improved in civility.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.The recollection of what I then said,of my conduct,my manners,my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.Your reproof,so well applied,I shall never forget:\u0026#39;had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\u0026#39; Those were your words.You know not,you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time,I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”","cnt":0,"sort":14011600,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011599.html","next":"14011601.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
