Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door;her husband looked impenetrably grave;her daughters,alarmed,anxious,uneasy.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Lydia\u0026#39;s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open,and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;and he scarcely opened his lips.The easy assurance of the young couple,indeed,was enough to provoke him.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still;untamed,unabashed,wild,noisy,and fearless. She turned from sister to sister,demanding their congratulations;and when at length they all sat down,looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh,that it was a great while since she had been there.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing,that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address,while he claimed their relationship,would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance;but she sat down,resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed,and Jane blushed;but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     There was no want of discourse.The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Only think of its being three months,”she cried,“since I went away;it seems but a fortnight I declare;and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.Good gracious!When I went away,I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!Though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.”Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible,gaily continued,\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it,and so I let down the side-glass next to him,and took off my glove,and let my hand just rest upon the window frame,so that he might see the ring,and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth could bear it no longer.She got up,and ran out of the room;and returned no more,till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour.She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia,with anxious parade,walk up to her mother\u0026#39;s right hand,and hear her say to her eldest sister,\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Ah!Jane,I take your place now,and you must go lower,because I am a married woman.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips,the Lucases,and all their other neighbours,and to hear herself called“Mrs.Wickham”by each of them;and in the mean time,she went after dinner to show her ring,and boast of being married,to Mrs.Hill and the two housemaids.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Well, mamma,”said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room,“and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck.They must all go to Brighton.That is the place to get husbands.What a pity it is, mamma,we did not all go.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Very true;and if I had my will,we should.But my dear Lydia,I don\u0026#39;t at all like your going such a way off.Must it be so?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh, lord! yes; —there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.You and papa,and my sisters,must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter,and I dare say there will be some balls,and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I should like it beyond anything!”said her mother.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “And then when you go away,you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you;and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I thank you for my share of the favour,”said Elizabeth;“but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”","cnt":0,"sort":14011582,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011581.html","next":"14011583.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
