Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings,had she seen him so desirous to please,so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve,as now,when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours,and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour;and when they arose to depart,Mr.Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr.and Mrs.Gardiner,and Miss Bennet,to dinner at Pemberley,before they left the country.Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,readily obeyed.Mrs.Gardiner looked at her niece,desirous of knowing how she,whom the invitation most concerned,felt disposed as to its acceptance,but Elizabeth had turned away her head.Presuming however,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal,and seeing in her husband,who was fond of society,a perfect willingness to accept it,she ventured to engage for her attendance,and the day after the next was fixed on.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again,having still a great deal to say to her,and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased,and on this account,as well as some others,found herself,when their visitors left them,capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction,though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt,she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley,and then hurried away to dress.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But she had no reason to fear Mr.and Mrs.Gardiner\u0026#39;s curiosity;it was not their wish to force her communication.It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr.Darcy than they had before any idea of;it was evident that he was very much in love with her.They saw much to interest,but nothing to justify inquiry.","cnt":0,"sort":14011562,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011561.html","next":"14011563.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
