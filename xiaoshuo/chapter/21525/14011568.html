It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him,as now,when all love must be vain.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation,the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care;and covering her face with her handkerchief,Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;and, after a pause of several minutes,was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion,who,in a manner which, though it spoke compassion,spoke likewise restraint,said,\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence,nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay,but real,though unavailing concern.Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\u0026#39;s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh,yes.Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible,I know it cannot be long.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He readily assured her of his secrecy;again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations,with only one serious,parting look,went away.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     As he quitted the room,Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire;and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance,and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.","cnt":0,"sort":14011568,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011567.html","next":"14011569.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
