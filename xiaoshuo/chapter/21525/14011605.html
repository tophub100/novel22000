He heard her with astonishment.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “This is an evening of wonders, indeed!And so, Darcy did every thing;made up the match,gave the money,paid the fellow\u0026#39;s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy.Had it been your uncle\u0026#39;s doing,I must and would have paid him;but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.I shall offer to pay him to-morrow;he will rant and storm about his love for you,and there will be an end of the matter.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before,on his reading Mr. Collins\u0026#39;s letter; and after laughing at her some time,allowed her at last to go—saying,as she quitted the room,“If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,send them in,for I am quite at leisure.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth\u0026#39;s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight;and,after half an hour\u0026#39;s quiet reflection in her own room,she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.Every thing was too recent for gaiety,but the evening passed tranquilly away;there was no longer anything material to be dreaded,and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night,she followed her,and made the important communication.Its effect was most extraordinary;for on first hearing it,Mrs.Bennet sat quite still,and unable to utter a syllable.Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again,wonder,and bless herself.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Good gracious! Lord bless me!only think!dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true?Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be!What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!Jane\u0026#39;s is nothing to it—nothing at all.I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh,my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy.A house in town!Every thing that is charming!Three daughters married!Ten thousand a year!Oh,Lord!What will become of me.I shall go distracted.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted;and Elizabeth,rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,her mother followed her.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “My dearest child,”she cried,“I can think of nothing else!Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! \u0026#39;Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence.You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,that I may have it to-morrow.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     This was a sad omen of what her mother\u0026#39;s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be;and Elizabeth found that,though in the certain possession of his warmest affection,and secure of her relations\u0026#39;consent,there was still something to be wished for.But the morrow passed off much better than she expected;for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him,unless it was in her power to offer him any attention,or mark her deference for his opinion.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him;and Mr.Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,”said he.“Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane\u0026#39;s.”","cnt":0,"sort":14011605,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011604.html","next":"14011606.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
