But so they always are.The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last;but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,more,I think,than last year.His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Mr.Collins had a compliment,and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon,she added:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But if that is the case,you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer.Mrs.Collins will be very glad of your company,I am sure.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,”replied Elizabeth,“but it is not in my power to accept it.I must be in town next Saturday.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Why,at that rate,you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh!your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete,it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London,for I am going there early in June,for a week;and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box,there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed,if the weather should happen to be cool,I should not object to taking you both,as you are neither of you large.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You are all kindness,madam;but I believe we must abide by our original plan.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Lady Catherine seemed resigned.“Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them.You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.It is highly improper.You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer,I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her.Miss Darcy,the daughter of Mr.Darcy,of Pemberley,and Lady Anne,could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.I am excessively attentive to all those things.You must send John with the young ladies,Mrs. Collins.I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “My uncle is to send a servant for us.”","cnt":0,"sort":14011544,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011543.html","next":"14011545.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
