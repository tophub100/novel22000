He did every thing best in the world;and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September,than any body else in the country.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters,she said to Elizabeth:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by,when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “No really,”replied Elizabeth;“I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “La!You are so strange!But I must tell you how it went off.We were married, you know, at St. Clement\u0026#39;s, because Wickham\u0026#39;s lodgings were in that parish.And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o\u0026#39;clock.My uncle and aunt and I were to go together;and the others were to meet us at the church.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Well,Monday morning came,and I was in such a fuss!I was so afraid,you know,that something would happen to put it off,and then I should have gone quite distracted.And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing,preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.However,I did not hear above one word in ten,for I was thinking,you may suppose,of my dear Wickham.I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Well,and so we breakfasted at ten as usual;I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you\u0026#39;ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors,though I was there a fortnight.Not one party,or scheme, or anything.To be sure London was rather thin,but,however,the Little Theatre was open.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr.Stone.And then,you know,when once they get together,there is no end of it.Well,I was so frightened I did not know what to do,for my uncle was to give me away;and if we were beyond the hour,we could not be married all day.But,luckily,he came back again in ten minutes\u0026#39; time,and then we all set out.However,I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,the wedding need not be put off,for Mr.Darcy might have done as well.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Mr.Darcy!”repeated Elizabeth,in utter amazement.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh,yes!—he was to come there with Wickham,you know.But gracious me!I quite forgot!I ought not to have said a word about it.I promised them so faithfully!What will Wickham say?It was to be such a secret!”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “If it was to be secret,”said Jane,“say not another word on the subject.You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh!certainly,”said Elizabeth,though burning with curiosity;“we will ask you no questions.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Thank you,”said Lydia,“for if you did,I should certainly tell you all,and then Wickham would be angry.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     On such encouragement to ask,Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power,by running away.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible;or at least it was impossible not to try for information.Mr.Darcy had been at her sister\u0026#39;s wedding.It was exactly a scene,and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.Conjectures as to the meaning of it,rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her,as placing his conduct in the noblest light,seemed most improbable.She could not bear such suspense;and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt,to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropped,if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You may readily comprehend,”she added,“what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us,and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.Pray write instantly,and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary;and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Not that I shall,though,”she added to herself,as she finished the letter;“and my dear aunt,if you do not tell me in an honourable manner,I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Jane\u0026#39;s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall;Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction,she had rather be without a confidante.","cnt":0,"sort":14011583,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011582.html","next":"14011584.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
