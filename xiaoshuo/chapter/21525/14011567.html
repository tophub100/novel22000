Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\u0026#39;s short letter to Mrs.F.gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F.,who,instantly taking the alarm,set off from B.intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;for on entering that place,they removed into a hackney coach,and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.I know not what to think.After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes,and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield,but without any success—no such people had been seen to pass through.With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan;and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia\u0026#39;s connections,which is not likely,can I suppose her so lost to everything?Impossible!I grieve to find,however,that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes,and said he feared W.was not a man to be trusted.My poor mother is really ill,and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected.And as to my father,I never in my life saw him so affected.Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.I am truly glad,dearest Lizzy,that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes;but now,as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,however,as to press for it,if inconvenient.Adieu!I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not;but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,that I am not afraid of requesting it,though I have still something more to ask of the former.My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way,and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle\u0026#39;s advice and assistance would be everything in the world;he will immediately comprehend what I must feel,and I rely upon his goodness.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Oh! where, where is my uncle?”cried Elizabeth,darting from her seat as she finished the letter,in eagerness to follow him,without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\u0026#39;s situation, hastily exclaimed,“I beg your pardon,but I must leave you.I must find Mr.Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed;I have not an instant to lose.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Good God! what is the matter?”cried he, with more feeling than politeness;then recollecting himself,“I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.You are not well enough;you cannot go yourself.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible,to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,“Let me call your maid.Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?A glass of wine;shall I get you one?You are very ill.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “No,I thank you,”she replied,endeavouring to recover herself.“There is nothing the matter with me.I am quite well;I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     She burst into tears as she alluded to it,and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern,and observe her in compassionate silence.At length she spoke again.“I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped;has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham.They are gone off together from Brighton.You know him too well to doubt the rest.She has no money,no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Darcy was fixed in astonishment.","cnt":0,"sort":14011567,"author":"(英)简·奥斯汀","prev":"14011566.html","next":"14011568.html","book_title":"傲慢与偏见","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:34","category":"都市小说"}
