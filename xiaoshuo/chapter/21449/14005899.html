I wonder what started him so suddenly?Could it have been hunger that made him desperate,or was he frightened by something in the night?Maybe he suddenly felt fear.But he was such a calm,strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It is strange.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,”he said.“ You\u0026#39;re holding him again but you cannot get line.But soon he has to circle .”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off his face.He was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength.When his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise.He\u0026#39;s headed almost east,he thought.That means he is tired and going with the current.Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It is not bad.”he said.“And pain does not matter to a man.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You did not do so badly for something worthless,”he said to his left hand.“But there was a moment when I could not find you.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Why was I not born with two good hands?He thought.Perhaps it was my fault in not training that one properly.But God knows he has had enough chances to learn.He did not do so badly in the night,though,and he has only cramped once.If he cramps again let the line cut him off.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he should chew some more of the dolphin.But I can\u0026#39;t,he told himself.It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea.And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it.I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad.But it is too late to try for strength now through nourishment.You\u0026#39;re stupid, he told himself.Eat the other flying fish.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It was there,cleaned and ready,and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought.At least the kind of strength that I need.Now I have done what I can,he thought.Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling.It was too early for that.He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand.It tightened,as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break,line began to come in.He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It is a very big circle,”he said.“ But he is circling.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Then the line would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “He is making the far part of his circle now,”he said. I must hold all I can,he thought.The strain will shorten his circle each time.Perhaps in an hour I will see him.Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead.He was not afraid of the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line.Twice,though,he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this.”he said.“Now that I have him coming so beautifully,God help me endure.I\u0026#39;ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys.But I cannot say them now.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Consider them said,he thought.I\u0026#39;ll say them later.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Just then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands.It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He is hitting the wire leader with his spear,he thought. That was bound to come.He had to do that.It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air.But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Don\u0026#39;t jump,fish,”he said.“ Don\u0026#39;t jump.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a little line.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     I must hold his pain where it is,he thought.Mine does not matter.I can control mine.But his pain could drive him mad.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again.The old man was gaining line steadily now.But he felt faint again.He lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on his head.Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I have no cramps.”he said.“ He\u0026#39;ll be up soon and I can last.You have to last.Don\u0026#39;t even speak of it.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He kneeled against the bow and,for a moment,slipped the line over his back again.I\u0026#39;ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in,he decided.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the boat,the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     I\u0026#39;m tireder than I have ever been,he thought,and now the trade wind is rising.But that will be good to take him in with.I need that badly.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I\u0026#39;ll rest on the next turn as he goes out,”he said.“I feel much better.Then in two or three turns more I will have him.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     You work now,fish,he thought.I\u0026#39;ll take you at the turn.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The sea had risen considerably.But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get home.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I\u0026#39;ll just steer south and west.”he said.“A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could not believe its length.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “No,”he said.“ He can\u0026#39;t be that big.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water.It was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water.It raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him.His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     On this circle the old man could see the fish\u0026#39;s eye and the two gray sucking fish that swam around him.Sometimes they attached themselves to him.Sometimes they darted off. Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow.They were each over three feet long and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun.On each calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn\u0026#39;t try for the head.I must get the heart.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Be calm and strong,old man,”he said.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     On the next circle the fish\u0026#39;s back was out but he was a little too far from the boat.On the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving.The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer.For just a moment the fish turned a little on his side.Then he straightened himself and began another circle.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I moved him,”the old man said.“ I moved him then.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could.I moved him,he thought.Maybe this time I can get him over.Pull,hands,he thought.Hold up,legs.Last for me,head.Last for me.You never went.This time I\u0026#39;ll pull him over.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Fish,”the old man said.“ Fish,you are going to have to die anyway.Do you have to kill me too?”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now.I must get him alongside this time,he thought.I am not good for many more turns.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Yes you are,he told himself.You\u0026#39;re good for ever.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     On the next turn,he nearly had him.But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     You are killing me fish,the old man thought.But you have a right to.Never have I seen a greater,or more beautiful,or a calmer or more noble thing than you,brother.Come on and kill me.I do not care who kills who.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Now you are getting confused in the head,he thought. You must keep your head clear.Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man.Or a fish,he thought.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Clear up,head,”he said in a voice he could hardly hear.“ Clear up.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Twice more it was the same on the turns.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     I do not know,the old man thought.He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time.I do not know.But I will try it once more.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish.The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     I\u0026#39;ll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He tried it again and it was the same.So,he thought,and he felt himself going before he started;I will try it once again.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish\u0026#39;s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat,long,deep,wide,silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength,and more strength he had just summoned, into the fish\u0026#39;s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man\u0026#39;s chest.He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Then the fish came alive,with his death in him,and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty.He seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff.Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and,when he could see,he saw the fish was on his back with his silver belly up.The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish\u0026#39;s shoulder and the sea was discoloring with the red of the blood from his heart.First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep.Then it spread like a cloud.The fish was silver and still and floated with the waves.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and laid his head on his hands.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Keep my head clear,”he said against the wood of the bow.“ I am a tired old man.But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside ,he thought.Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out,this skiff would never hold him.I must prepare everything,then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow.I want to see him, he thought,and to touch and to feel him.He is my fortune, he thought.But that is not why I wish to feel him.I think I felt his heart,he thought.When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time.Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Get to work,old man,”he said.He took a very small drink of the water.“ There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish.He looked at the sun carefully.It is not much more than noon,he thought.And the trade wind is rising.The lines all mean nothing now.The boy and I will splice them when we are home.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Come on,fish,”he said.But the fish did not come. Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff up onto him.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     When he was even with him and had the fish\u0026#39;s head against the bow he could not believe his size.But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt,passed it through the fish\u0026#39;s gills and out his jaws,made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill,made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow.He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail.The fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver,and the stripes showed the same pale violet color as his tail.They were wider than a man\u0026#39;s hand with his fingers spread and the fish\u0026#39;s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a procession.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “It was the only way to kill him,”the old man said.He was feeling better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear.He\u0026#39;s over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is,he thought.Maybe much more.If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I need a pencil for that,”he said.“My head is not that clear.But I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today.I had no bone spurs.But the hands and the back hurt truly.”I wonder what a bone spur is,he thought.Maybe we have them without knowing of it.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart.He was so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside.He cut a piece of line and tied the fish\u0026#39;s lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible.Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged,the patched sail drew,the boat began to move,and half lying in the stern he sailed southwest.","cnt":0,"sort":14005899,"author":"(美)欧内斯特·海明威","prev":"14005898.html","next":"14005900.html","book_title":"老人与海","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:42","category":"都市小说"}
