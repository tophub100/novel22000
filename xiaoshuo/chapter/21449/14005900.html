He only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail.I better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture .But he could not find a spoon and his sardines were rotten.So he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff.There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas.The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had eaten the shrimps.The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm.He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end,he had thought perhaps it was a dream.Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell,he was sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it. Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream.The hands cure quickly,he thought.I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them.The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that there is.All I must do is keep the head clear.The hands have done their work and we sail well.With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers.Then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought,is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in?If I were towing him behind there would be no question.Nor if the fish were in the skiff,with all dignity gone,there would be no question either.But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought,let him bring me in if it pleases him.I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head clear.There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night.The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true.It was an hour before the first shark hit him.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The shark was not an accident .He had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea.He had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun.Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had taken.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Sometimes he lost the scent.But he would pick it up again,or have just a trace of it and he swam fast and hard on the course.He was a very big Mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     His back was as blue as a sword fish\u0026#39;s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome.He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast,just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering.Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards.They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks.They were shaped like a man\u0026#39;s fingers when they are crisped like claws.They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting edges on both sides.This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea,that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy.Now he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and would do exactly what he wished.He prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he watched the shark come on.The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man\u0026#39;s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope.It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in.It might as well have been a dream,he thought.I cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe I can get him.Dentuso,he thought.Bad luck to your mother.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail.The shark\u0026#39;s head was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark\u0026#39;s head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose.There were no such lines.There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws.But that was the location of the brain and the old man hit it.He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength.He hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy .\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once again,wrapping himself in two loops of the rope.The old man knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it.Then,on his back,with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking,the shark plowed over the water as a speed-boat does.The water was white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when the rope came taut ,shivered, and then snapped.The shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very slowly.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “He took about forty pounds,”the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too and all the rope,he thought,and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated.When the fish had been hit it was as though he himself were hit.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But I killed the shark that hit my fish,he thought.And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen.And God knows that I have seen big ones.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It was too good to last,he thought.I wish it had been a dream now and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “But man is not made for defeat,”he said.“A man can be destroyed but not defeated.”I am sorry that I killed the fish though,he thought.Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon.The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent.But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not,he thought.Perhaps I was only better armed.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Don\u0026#39;t think,old man,”he said aloud.“Sail on this course and take it when it comes.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But I must think,he thought.Because it is all I have left. That and baseball.I wonder how the great DiMaggio would have liked the way I hit him in the brain?It was no great thing, he thought.Any man could do it.But do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone spurs?I cannot know. I never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Think about something cheerful,old man,”he said.“Every minute now you are closer to home.You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part of the current.But there was nothing to be done now.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Yes there is,”he said aloud.“ I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Now,”he said.“I am still an old man.But I am not unarmed.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of the fish and some of his hope returned.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     It is silly not to hope,he thought.Besides I believe it is a sin .Do not think about sin,he thought.There are enough problems now without sin.Also I have no understanding of it.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it.Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish.I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin.It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it.Let them think about it.You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish.San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great DiMaggio.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio,he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin.You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food,he thought.You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman.You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after.If you love him,it is not a sin to kill him.Or is it more?\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You think too much,old man,”he said aloud.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     But you enjoyed killing the dentuso,he thought.He lives on the live fish as you do.He is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are.He is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I killed him in self-defense,”the old man said aloud.“And I killed him well.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Besides,he thought,everything kills everything else in some way.Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive.The boy keeps me alive,he thought.I must not deceive myself too much.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut him.He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste.It was firm and juicy ,like meat,but it was not red.There was no springiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the market.But there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the old man knew that a very bad time was coming.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The breeze was steady.It had backed a little further into the northeast and he knew that meant that it would not fall off.The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. There were only the flying fish that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of gulf-weed.He could not even see a bird.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He had ailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit of the meat from the marlin,trying to rest and to be strong,when he saw the first of the two sharks.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Ay,”he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily,feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Galanos.”he said aloud.He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the brown, triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail.They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement.But they were closing all the time.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller. Then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it.He lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain. Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them.He closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come.He could see their wide,flattened,shovel-pointed heads now and their white-tipped wide pectoral fins.They were hateful sharks, bad smelling,scavengers as well as killers,and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat.It was these sharks that would cut the turtles\u0026#39;legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in the water,if they were hungry,even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “Ay,”the old man said.“ Galanos.Come on Galanos.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     They came. But they did not come as the Mako had come.One turned and went out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish.The other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten.The line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture,withdrew it,and drove it in again into the shark\u0026#39;s yellow cat-like eyes.The shark let go of the fish and slid down,swallowing what he had taken as he died.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark out from under.When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him.He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in.The blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too.But the shark came up fast and his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came out of water and lay against the fish.The old man withdrew the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again.He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye.The shark still hung there.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “No?”the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain.It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever.The old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark\u0026#39;s jaws to open them.He twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said,“Go on,galano. Slide down a mile deep.Go see your friend,or maybe it\u0026#39;s your mother.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar.Then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,”he said aloud.“I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him.I\u0026#39;m sorry about it,fish.It makes everything wrong.”He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now.Drained of blood and awash he looked the color of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes still showed.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I shouldn\u0026#39;t have gone out so far,fish,”he said.“ Neither for you nor for me.I\u0026#39;m sorry,fish.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut.Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I wish I had a stone for the knife,”the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt.“I should have brought a stone.”You should have brought many things,he thought.But you did not bring them,old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have.Think of what you can do with what there is.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “You give me much good counsel ,”he said aloud.“ I\u0026#39;m tired of it.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “God knows how much that last one took,”he said.“But she\u0026#39;s much lighter now.”He did not want to think of the mutilated under-side of the fish.He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     He was a fish to keep a man all winter,he thought.Don\u0026#39;t think of that.Just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him.The blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water.Besides they do not bleed much.There is nothing cut that means anything.The bleeding may keep the left from cramping.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     What can I think of now?He thought.Nothing.I must think of nothing and wait for the next ones.I wish it had really been a dream,he thought.But who knows?It might have turned out well.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The next shark that came was a single shovel-nose.He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it.The old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into his brain. But the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     The old man settled himself to steer.He did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water,showing first life-size,then small,then tiny.That always fascinated the old man.But he did not even watch it now.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     “I have the gaff now,”he said.“ But it will do no good.I have the two oars and the tiller and the short club.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e     Now they have beaten me,he thought.I am too old to club sharks to death.But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.","cnt":0,"sort":14005900,"author":"(美)欧内斯特·海明威","prev":"14005899.html","next":"14005901.html","book_title":"老人与海","updateTimeFmt":"2024-03-30 12:32:42","category":"都市小说"}
